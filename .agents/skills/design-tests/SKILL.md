# Design And Implement Tests

Read:

- root `AGENTS.md`
- `.agents/PLANS.md`
- the active testing WorkPlan, plus the parent index/resume/active milestone
  packet when test architecture supports an indexed operation
- governing product designs and implementation paths
- existing tests, fixtures, CI gates, timing evidence, and recent failures

Create or resume a WorkPlan whose work type is `testing` when the work is
long-running. Keep product-semantic changes in a separate design,
implementation, or debugging WorkPlan.

## Cost-Aware Test Architecture

Keep exactly one writer for overlapping test, timing, and workflow artifacts.
Use Spark-class mapper and error-detective roles for owner inventory, collection
counts, durations, workflow arguments, shard overlap, and the smallest
discriminating command. Reserve Terra-class reviewers for a coherent topology
change. Do not repeatedly run broad suites while iterating: run focused
discriminating checks, then run each required broad or dedicated gate once at
the candidate revision.

Use dedicated exhaustive jobs only when they prove a unique invariant and do
not duplicate another required job. Record the allocation and model-tier
rationale in the WorkPlan delegation and cost ledger.

Apply the delegation task packet, artifact-only context, writer completion,
long-command ownership, and candidate freeze contracts in `.agents/PLANS.md`.
Do not launch reviewers while test, timing, or workflow artifacts are moving.

Keep test-architecture decisions in the testing WorkPlan. Link their results
from the affected milestone packet without copying detailed timing, topology,
or review history into the parent implementation index.

## 1. Establish The Test Contract

For every requirement or risk, record:

- supported behavior and canonical execution path
- defect family the test must detect
- strongest appropriate test level
- oracle and fixture authority
- observable failure signal
- expected runtime and intended gate
- exact workflow job, matrix entry, shard, aggregate, and timing owner

Maintain a machine-readable or mechanically testable path-to-gate map for each
changed test, fixture, generator, golden, timing artifact, workflow pin, job,
matrix entry, shard, and aggregate. The map must identify the exact local
command when one exists and explicitly mark CI-only actions.

Separate evidence gaps from product defects. Missing tests do not establish P1
or P2 without demonstrated product impact.

## 2. Inventory Before Adding

Map existing positive, negative, boundary, retry, replay, concurrency,
migration, compatibility, and failure coverage. Identify:

- exact duplicates and overlapping equivalence classes
- tests bound to retired schemas, fixtures, APIs, or implementation details
- expensive tests mislabeled as unit tests
- fixture generators or trust material shipped in production packages
- tests whose assertions cannot fail when the target behavior regresses
- suites, nodes, fixtures, helpers, commands, or jobs named after requirements,
  evidence coordinates, temporary milestones, review rounds, or task IDs

Do not add a new test until its distinct failure signal is stated. Prefer
extending the canonical current-contract suite over creating a parallel suite.

## 3. Design The Suite Topology

Use stable behavioral names. Name files, fixtures, helpers, symbols, and jobs
after the contract they validate, never after internal milestones such as M0,
M1, C2, requirement IDs such as R22 or SIA-R22, evidence IDs, review rounds,
issue numbers, or temporary implementation phases. Requirement IDs are values
only in exact typed traceability fields and explicit rejection vectors; they
never name executable tests, groups, commands, or general fixtures.
Preserve version labels only when they are genuine public, wire, schema,
fixture-format, or migration identities.

Choose the narrowest level that proves the behavior:

- unit: fast, deterministic, isolated logic with no subprocess, packaging,
  network, large artifact generation, or repeated full-system construction
- contract: public/schema/adapter compatibility at one boundary
- integration: interactions between real owners, persistence, subprocesses,
  packaging, restarts, or concurrency
- acceptance: supported end-to-end behavior through public composition
- benchmark or live: performance or provider behavior, kept distinct from
  deterministic correctness

Property or parameterized tests should cover equivalence classes without
copying large case matrices. Keep independent loaders or compilers independent;
do not share the oracle implementation.

Fakes and mocks must model the real boundary's failures and side effects. Do
not mock the service under test, canonical validator, serializer, or transaction
owner. Changed composition roots need at least one proof through the real
adapters and validation path up to the external boundary.

Deterministic suites must not depend on wall-clock time, ambient randomness,
unordered iteration, real networks, or sleeps. Inject clocks, seeds, IDs, and
completion signals. Keep intentionally probabilistic or live evidence outside
deterministic PR proof.

## 4. Budget Runtime And Gates

Measure collection count and wall time before and after material changes. Set a
runtime budget for each suite and gate.

BVT and PR-fast verification must be a small representative sample that gives rapid
signal on mainstream paths and critical trust boundaries. It must not become a
synonym for the full test corpus. Select cases explicitly and record why each
represents a failure family.

Route exhaustive matrices, packaging, large generated artifacts, slow
subprocess tests, broad compatibility permutations, and long-running acceptance
checks to dedicated parallel gates. Preserve full coverage there; do not weaken
assertions, thresholds, warnings, or supported families merely to meet the fast
gate budget.

A dedicated slow-exhaustive gate may still be required on pull requests when it
proves a unique merge-blocking invariant, has a measured budget, and does not
rerun a broad suite merely to add one case. It is not BVT or PR-fast.

For every added or moved test, prove one intended required-job owner and remove
accidental duplicate collection across fast shards and dedicated exhaustive
jobs. Assign collection, timing, and long-command ownership to one delegate and
record the measured result in the WorkPlan.

Treat unexplained runtime growth as a test-architecture regression. Prefer
shared immutable setup, session-scoped derivation, smaller authoritative
fixtures, and boundary-level proofs over repeated full reconstruction.

## 5. Implement And Prune Together

Use one writer for overlapping tests and fixtures. When replacing a suite:

1. create a case-by-case retention map
2. migrate still-valid behaviors to current-contract owners
3. run the migrated cases and prove their failure signals
4. delete obsolete tests, fixtures, helpers, and CI references in the same change
5. search for stale imports, paths, names, WorkPlan references, and packaged bytes
6. update the `.agents/PLANS.md` identity ledger across tests, fixtures,
   generators, goldens, registries, timing data, and workflow labels

Do not retain historical tests merely because they once caught a bug. Preserve
the invariant in a current test; remove the obsolete mechanism. Do not delete a
negative suite based only on passing tests or age.

## 6. Verify The Test Architecture

Run focused tests first, then applicable gates. Record:

- selected and collected tests
- pass/fail result and wall time
- before/after count and duration
- gate placement and timeout headroom
- retained, migrated, deleted, and intentionally deferred cases
- source/wheel isolation when fixture authority is test-only
- workflow identity and local command-equivalence evidence
- complete timing ownership for the duration-balanced unit inventory
- field-aware identity-gate coverage, exact exception inventory, and mutations
  proving each changed surface rejects planning/evidence coordinates and
  accepts the fixed legitimate-name corpus from `.agents/PLANS.md`

Read current GitHub workflows directly. Prove every added or moved test is
collected by a required job, included in the correct matrix or deterministic
shard, represented in timing evidence, and reflected in the aggregate check.
Do not accept median or default timing assignments as final closure evidence
for new tests. Add a workflow-structure contract when a gate's triggers, argv,
matrix, timeout, or aggregation is required behavior.

Reconcile that inventory with the actual live diff and the changed-surface,
authority-chain, gate, and known-failure ledgers in `.agents/PLANS.md`. A gate
is not covered merely because a nearby focused suite passed; every affected
job, matrix entry, shard, generated-artifact check, and aggregate must have a
current result or an explicit CI-only evidence status.

Maintain an owner-or-exemption ledger for dedicated deterministic jobs outside
the duration-balanced unit inventory. Each dedicated target must name its job,
runtime budget, timeout headroom, and reason it does not use unit-shard timing.

Before completing any testing milestone, append the revision-bound closure
record from `.agents/PLANS.md` and require
`remaining_validated_p1_p2: []`. For PR-associated changes, verify all
scope-required GitHub and external acceptance gates on their actual event and
executed SHA/ref.

Use mutation, temporary implementation breakage, or an equivalent discriminating
experiment for high-risk tests to prove they fail for the intended reason.

Run independent `test_reviewer` and `correctness_reviewer` passes for a coherent
test-architecture change. Reconcile findings under `AGENTS.md` and the testing
completion contract in `.agents/PLANS.md`.

Run those reviewers once per coherent topology change. Use narrow delta review
after a bounded correction; do not repeat a full review after a micro-edit.

## Completion

Complete only when requirements map to current tests, every retained test has a
distinct failure signal, obsolete artifacts are removed, suite topology and CI
placement match runtime budgets, fast gates remain representative, exhaustive
coverage remains enforced elsewhere, behavioral naming is used, the field-aware
identity gate and its mutation tests pass, and deterministic evidence passes at
the exact revision. Actual scope-required GitHub checks and
external gates are required before claiming their corresponding enforced or
operational maturity.
